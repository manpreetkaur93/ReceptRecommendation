"Roasted Whole Red Snapper With Tomatoes, Basil, And Oregano by Scott Conant",1949,US,"One of the reasons why I chose to work with the Alzheimer’s Association is because my grandmother had dementia and some of the most meaningful moments I had with her were around the table, sharing a meal. So, I wanted to create a recipe that’s fun, easy, full of flavor, and, most importantly, can be enjoyed together with friends and loved ones. Words alone can’t convey how magnificent, how beautifully ceremonial a whole fish looks when presented at the table. I’m always excited when I and a few friends settle in to devour one. (And devour we do, you should see how little is left when we’re through with it.) Aside from being so good-looking, a whole fish also offers much more flavor because the head and the bones add depth to the accompanying sauce.
